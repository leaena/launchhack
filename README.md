# John Muir Trail Auto-Blogger #
The JMT auto-blogger is a single-page web app providing a full daily blog with minimal startup and zero ongoing effort for long-distance hikers. Make your family and friends feel included on your journey without needing internet connectivity on the trail. This project was implemented by the Acyclic Directed Giraffes ([katemonkeys], [leaena], [pbarchana]) for the LAUNCH Hackathon in San Francisco, CA, Feb 21-23, 2014.

## How it Works ##

A new user inputs the start date and number of days for their planned trip, at which time JMTAB generates a custom itinerary, proposing roughly equidistant campsites for the ~2-3 week trip. These campsites can be changed or updated, and layover days can be included. Once the itinerary is finalized, you can go on your trip and not worry about keeping in touch. Each morning, a scrapbook-style blog entry is generated using recent and seasonally appropriate trip reports from the relevant section of the trail, selected writings from the exact area from the legendary nature writers, ranger reports, weather data, and so on.

Eventual optimizations include a social component to help plan resupplies and the ability to upload video updates on civilization days.
