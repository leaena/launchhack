p After the first mile, the trail made a sharp turn and we were looking back over the length of the valley we had just traversed the day before.  It really gave me a sense of how much distance we’d covered as you could see the peaks of the Kaweah that we’d seen days earlier.  This section was about another mile but the grade was less steep than the first section.  The clouds continued to hold and now we were worrying we might have some rain.  Our friend’s nose started bleeding again, but it didn’t take as long to control this time and this would be the last time he got one on the trip, thankfully.

p Next, the trail made another sharp as we entered the large gulley created by Wallace Creek.  The last two miles covered about 1000 feet of gain, so it’s relatively easy going.  We stopped for a snack break with about a mile to go and it was getting a little chilly when we stopped as the sun was now completely gone and the clouds were getting a little darker.
