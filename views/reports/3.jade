p Timberline Lake is another photogenic lake on the trail. This lake, however, has camping restrictions to help preserve its beauty. From this lake, the hiker has an excellent view of not only Mt. Whitney, but the entire ridge that the John Muir Trail traverses to reach its summit. Sit back, take a break and absorb one of the best views of Mt. Whitney.
