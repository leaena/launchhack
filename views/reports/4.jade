p From Crabtree, the JMT climbs steadily beside babbling Whitney Creek. We passed several smaller lakes, and stopped for lunch in a shady spot near the creek. At this altitude, the trees were sparse. They clustered around ponds, leaving much of the trail exposed to the hot sun. The trail cuts across a steep slope of scree that is often covered in snow, making it even more treacherous. Keep your eyes on the trail. When you want to look around, stop and steady yourself first. In our case, we had a few patches of snow, but their were plenty of boot prints leading the way and it wasnâ€™t too bad.
